### Speed Typing Test

#### Overview:
This Python project presents a fun and interactive way to test your typing speed and accuracy. The program utilizes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with the `tkinter` module, providing a user-friendly environment for the typing test. The test randomly selects a phrase for the user to type, and the program measures the time taken to accurately type out the phrase.

#### Features:
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The GUI features labels, buttons, and entry fields to create an intuitive typing test window.
- **Random Test Phrases**: The program randomly selects test phrases from a predefined list, adding variety to each typing test session.
- **Timing Measurement**: The `timeit` module is used to accurately measure the time taken by the user to type the given phrase.
- **Customization**: Users can experiment with adding more test phrases or integrate a third-party dictionary for a wider range of examples.

#### Installation:
No additional installations are required beyond Python itself.

#### Usage:
1. Run the Python script.
2. The GUI window will appear, featuring a test phrase to type and an entry field for typing.
3. Type the given phrase as quickly and accurately as possible.
4. Press the "Submit" button to submit your typed response.
5. The program will display your typing speed and accuracy, measured in words per minute (WPM).

#### Example:
- Start the typing test by running the Python script.
- Read the test phrase displayed in the GUI window and type it into the entry field.
- After submitting your response, the program will calculate and display your typing speed and accuracy.

#### Notes:
- Additional test phrases can be added to the program to enhance variety and challenge.
- Users can customize the program further by integrating third-party dictionaries or expanding the functionality of the GUI.

Enjoy testing your typing speed and accuracy with the Speed Typing Test program!
